# StyleMe

What to wear? What to wear?

StyleMe has the answer for guys with style (or who couldn't be bothered coming up with a look).

A fashion look book app for men that'll generate random style sets for Summer, Winter or a completely random ensemble for those who have the courage to try new things (or lost a bet ;))
